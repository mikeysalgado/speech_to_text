output_0.mp3,32852,good morning how are you
output_1.mp3,32852, good
output_10.mp3,48735,its been great hasnt it ive been blown away by the whole thing in fact im leaving
output_101.mp3,320826,there have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what i want to talk about one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that weve had and in all of the people here just the variety of it and the range of it the second is that its put us in a place where we have no idea whats going to happen in terms of the future no idea how this may play out
output_102.mp3,496787,i have an interest in education actually what i find is everybody has an interest in education dont you i find this very interesting if youre at a dinner party and you say you work in education  actually youre not often at dinner parties frankly
output_11.mp3,16970,if you work in education youre not asked
output_13.mp3,672748,and youre never asked back curiously thats strange to me but if you are and you say to somebody you know they say what do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face theyre like oh my god why me
output_15.mp3,192931,my one night out all week
output_17.mp3,32852,but if you ask about their education they pin you to the wall because its one of those things that goes deep with people am i right like religion and money and other things so i have a big interest in education and i think we all do we have a huge vested interest in it partly because its education thats meant to take us into this future that we cant grasp if you think of it children starting school this year will be retiring in two thousand and sixtyfive nobody has a clue despite all the expertise thats been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years time and yet were meant to be educating them for it so the unpredictability i think is extraordinary
output_18.mp3,65035,and the third part of this is that weve all agreed nonetheless on the really extraordinary capacities that children have  their capacities for innovation i mean sirena last night was a marvel wasnt she just seeing what she could do and shes exceptional but i think shes not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood what you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent and my contention is all kids have tremendous talents and we squander them pretty ruthlessly
output_19.mp3,32852,so i want to talk about education and i want to talk about creativity my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status
output_20.mp3,32852,thank you
output_22.mp3,48735,that was it by the way thank you very much
output_24.mp3,65035,so fifteen minutes left
output_26.mp3,177048,well i was born  
output_28.mp3,32852,i heard a great story recently  i love telling it  of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson she was six and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did the teacher was fascinated she went over to her and she said what are you drawing and the girl said im drawing a picture of god and the teacher said but nobody knows what god looks like and the girl said they will in a minute
output_3.mp3,96800,when my son was four in england  actually he was four everywhere to be honest
output_31.mp3,65035,if were being strict about it wherever he went he was four that year he was in the nativity play do you remember the story
output_33.mp3,656865,no it was big it was a big story mel gibson did the sequel you may have seen it
output_35.mp3,704931,nativity ii but james got the part of joseph which we were thrilled about we considered this to be one of the lead parts we had the place crammed full of agents in tshirts james robinson is joseph  he didnt have to speak but you know the bit where the three kings come in they come in bearing gifts gold frankincense and myrrh this really happened we were sitting there and i think they just went out of sequence because we talked to the little boy afterward and said you ok with that they said yeah why was that wrong they just switched the three boys came in fouryearolds with tea towels on their heads they put these boxes down and the first boy said i bring you gold and the second boy said i bring you myrrh and the third boy said frank sent this
output_37.mp3,128983,what these things have in common is that kids will take a chance if they dont know theyll have a go am i right theyre not frightened of being wrong i dont mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative what we do know is if youre not prepared to be wrong youll never come up with anything original  if youre not prepared to be wrong and by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity they have become frightened of being wrong and we run our companies like this we stigmatize mistakes and were now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities
output_38.mp3,32852,picasso once said this he said that all children are born artists the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up i believe this passionately that we dont grow into creativity we grow out of it or rather we get educated out of it so why is this
output_39.mp3,336709,i lived in stratfordonavon until about five years ago in fact we moved from stratford to los angeles so you can imagine what a seamless transition this was
output_40.mp3,112683,actually we lived in a place called snitterfield just outside stratford which is where shakespeares father was born are you struck by a new thought i was you dont think of shakespeare having a father do you do you because you dont think of shakespeare being a child do you shakespeare being seven i never thought of it i mean he was seven at some point he was in somebodys english class wasnt he
output_42.mp3,112683,how annoying would that be
output_44.mp3,65035,must try harder
output_46.mp3,16970,being sent to bed by his dad to shakespeare go to bed now to william shakespeare and put the pencil down
output_48.mp3,65035,and stop speaking like that
output_5.mp3,240996,its confusing everybody
output_51.mp3,368892,anyway we moved from stratford to los angeles and i just want to say a word about the transition actually my son didnt want to come ive got two kids hes twentyone now my daughters sixteen he didnt want to come to los angeles he loved it but he had a girlfriend in england this was the love of his life sarah hed known her for a month
output_53.mp3,192931,mind you theyd had their fourth anniversary because its a long time when youre sixteen he was really upset on the plane he said ill never find another girl like sarah and we were rather pleased about that frankly 
output_55.mp3,48735,because she was the main reason we were leaving the country
output_57.mp3,689048,but something strikes you when you move to america and travel around the world every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects every one doesnt matter where you go youd think it would be otherwise but it isnt at the top are mathematics and languages then the humanities at the bottom are the arts everywhere on earth and in pretty much every system too theres a hierarchy within the arts art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance there isnt an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics why why not i think this is rather important i think math is very important but so is dance children dance all the time if theyre allowed to we all do we all have bodies dont we did i miss a meeting
output_59.mp3,160748,truthfully what happens is as children grow up we start to educate them progressively from the waist up and then we focus on their heads and slightly to one side
output_6.mp3,65035,if you were to visit education as an alien and say whats it for public education i think youd have to conclude if you look at the output who really succeeds by this who does everything they should who gets all the brownie points who are the winners  i think youd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors isnt it theyre the people who come out the top and i used to be one so there
output_61.mp3,65035,and i like university professors but you know we shouldnt hold them up as the highwater mark of all human achievement theyre just a form of life another form of life but theyre rather curious and i say this out of affection for them theres something curious about professors in my experience  not all of them but typically  they live in their heads they live up there and slightly to one side theyre disembodied you know in a kind of literal way they look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads
output_63.mp3,96800,dont they its a way of getting their head to meetings
output_65.mp3,96800,if you want real evidence of outofbody experiences by the way get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night
output_67.mp3,48735,and there you will see it grown men and women writhing uncontrollably off the beat
output_69.mp3,32852,waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it
output_70.mp3,65035,our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability and theres a reason around the world there were no public systems of education really before the nineteenth century they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas
output_71.mp3,32852,number one that the most useful subjects for work are at the top so you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid things you liked on the grounds you would never get a job doing that is that right dont do music youre not going to be a musician dont do art you wont be an artist benign advice  now profoundly mistaken the whole world is engulfed in a revolution
output_72.mp3,256878,and the second is academic ability which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence because the universities design the system in their image if you think of it the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance and the consequence is that many highly talented brilliant creative people think theyre not because the thing they were good at at school wasnt valued or was actually stigmatized and i think we cant afford to go on that way
output_73.mp3,368892,in the next thirty years according to unesco more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history more people and its the combination of all the things weve talked about technology and its transformational effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population
output_74.mp3,401074,suddenly degrees arent worth anything isnt that true when i was a student if you had a degree you had a job if you didnt have a job its because you didnt want one and i didnt want one frankly
output_76.mp3,208813,but now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games because you need an ma where the previous job required a ba and now you need a phd for the other its a process of academic inflation and it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet we need to radically rethink our view of intelligence
output_77.mp3,16970,we know three things about intelligence one its diverse we think about the world in all the ways that we experience it we think visually we think in sound we think kinesthetically we think in abstract terms we think in movement secondly intelligence is dynamic if you look at the interactions of a human brain as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive the brain isnt divided into compartments in fact creativity  which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value  more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things
output_78.mp3,304944,by the way theres a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum its thicker in women following off from helen yesterday this is probably why women are better at multitasking because you are arent you theres a raft of research but i know it from my personal life if my wife is cooking a meal at home which is not often  thankfully
output_8.mp3,48735,no shes good at some things but if shes cooking shes dealing with people on the phone shes talking to the kids shes painting the ceiling 
output_81.mp3,48735,shes doing openheart surgery over here if im cooking the door is shut the kids are out the phones on the hook if she comes in i get annoyed i say terry please im trying to fry an egg in here
output_83.mp3,16970,give me a break
output_85.mp3,112683,actually do you know that old philosophical thing if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it did it happen remember that old chestnut i saw a great tshirt recently which said if a man speaks his mind in a forest and no woman hears him is he still wrong
output_87.mp3,32852,and the third thing about intelligence is its distinct im doing a new book at the moment called epiphany which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent im fascinated by how people got to be there its really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of gillian lynne have you heard of her some have shes a choreographer and everybody knows her work she did cats and phantom of the opera shes wonderful i used to be on the board of the royal ballet as you can see
output_89.mp3,128983,gillian and i had lunch one day i said how did you get to be a dancer it was interesting when she was at school she was really hopeless and the school in the thirtys wrote to her parents and said we think gillian has a learning disorder she couldnt concentrate she was fidgeting i think now theyd say she had adhd wouldnt you but this was the one thousand nine hundred and thirtys and adhd hadnt been invented at this point it wasnt an available condition
output_90.mp3,465022,people werent aware they could have that
output_92.mp3,368892,anyway she went to see this specialist so this oakpaneled room and she was there with her mother and she was led and sat on this chair at the end and she sat on her hands for twenty minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems gillian was having at school because she was disturbing people her homework was always late and so on little kid of eight in the end the doctor went and sat next to gillian and said ive listened to all these things your mothers told me i need to speak to her privately wait here well be back we wont be very long and they went and left her
output_93.mp3,65035,but as they went out of the room he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk and when they got out of the room he said to her mother just stand and watch her and the minute they left the room she was on her feet moving to the music and they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said mrs lynne gillian isnt sick shes a dancer take her to a dance school
output_94.mp3,32852,i said what happened she said she did i cant tell you how wonderful it was we walked in this room and it was full of people like me  people who couldnt sit still people who had to move to think who had to move to think they did ballet they did tap jazz they did modern they did contemporary she was eventually auditioned for the royal ballet school she became a soloist she had a wonderful career at the royal ballet she eventually graduated from the royal ballet school founded the gillian lynne dance company met andrew lloyd webber shes been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history shes given pleasure to millions and shes a multimillionaire somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down
output_96.mp3,544852,what i think it comes to is this al gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by rachel carson i believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity our education system has mined our minds in the way that we stripmine the earth for a particular commodity and for the future it wont serve us we have to rethink the fundamental principles on which were educating our children
output_97.mp3,368892,there was a wonderful quote by jonas salk who said if all the insects were to disappear from the earth within fifty years all life on earth would end if all human beings disappeared from the earth within fifty years all forms of life would flourish and hes right
output_98.mp3,656865,what ted celebrates is the gift of the human imagination we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that weve talked about and the only way well do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are and our task is to educate their whole being so they can face this future by the way  we may not see this future but they will and our job is to help them make something of it
output_99.mp3,128983,thank you very much
